# Machine Learning – MPG Prediction

This project uses the Auto MPG dataset to train a Linear Regression model that predicts
mileage (MPG) based on car features.

## Features:
- cylinders
- displacement
- horsepower
- weight
- acceleration
- model_year
- origin

## Model:
Linear Regression (sklearn)

## Results:
- Mean Squared Error: …
- R² Score: …
# Machine Learning Mini Projects (College)

This repository contains multiple mini machine learning projects developed as part of college coursework and practice.

Each project focuses on understanding basic machine learning concepts such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
